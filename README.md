# WILDSILK
Natural Eco fashion Compamy - 
WILDSILK a fashion home accessory Eco Company with a great experience team, from software developers, manufactures of textiles, with a Textile Fund supporting gifted artisans and designers.
All the designs are made in natural fabrics, silk, cotton, linen and wool. Why, mostly these fabrics work best in all weathers, as they are natural. 
The fashion market is flooded with low cost polyester designs, that are filling up landfills and the fibres are filtering through wash systems and getting into the oceans, I like my fish grilled without fibres. 
Our approach is simple, small collections, high quality textiles and working with small manufactures and Non Profits to allow the smaller players to access this vast market. (Â£262 Billion) 
The WDSK token is to enable payments across international boarders for designs to be created and sold locally and via e-commerce websites and
wildsilk.co.uk. 
WILDSILK aim is a 21st Century silk road, to aid trade and use AI and blockchain to keep overheads and finance charges low. 
Stellar is our chosen partner we hope with your help and support to create change in creative commercial enterprises and to apply better environmental practices.
